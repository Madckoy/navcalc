# 🧭 navcalc — Navigation Calculation Tool for Minecraft Bots
@Generated by ChatGPT — for the Pathfinder Project ⚙️

## 📌 Project Overview

This tool processes 3D scan data around a Minecraft bot to identify walkable and reachable navigation points.

- ✅ Parses structured block data from `.json`
- ✅ Filters out unsafe and unreachable blocks
- ✅ Determines walkable surfaces (with air clearance above)
- ✅ Applies BFS to find reachable points
- ✅ Selects optimal navigation targets (adaptive or even)

---

## 🧠 Core Modules

### 🔍 Filters (`core/navigation/filters`)
- `BotSafeBlockFilter` – filters out lava, cactus, water, etc.
- `BotThreadSurfaceFilter` – finds safe walkable surfaces (air clearance)
- `BotVerticalRangeFilter` – trims vertical layers around the bot

### 🔗 Resolvers (`core/navigation/resolvers`)
- `BotReachabilityResolver` – uses BFS to find reachable blocks

### 🎯 Target Selection (`core/navigation/selectors`)
- `BotExplorationTargetPlanner` – selects targets (adaptive or evenly spread)

### 📏 Evaluators (`core/navigation/evaluators`)
- `BotTargetReachabilityEvaluator` – (WIP) target feasibility checker

## 🧰 Utilities

- `BotBlockData` – holds position + material
- `BotLocation` – base class for 3D coordinates
- `BlockMaterialUtils` – provides block safety and type checks
- `BotGeoDataLoader` – loads data from `.json` files
- `BotGeoUtils` – helper functions for coordinate math

## 📊 Visualization

Uses `HtmlPlotGenerator` (with Plotly) to display:
- All scanned blocks (color-coded)
- Safe zones (gray)
- Walkable (green)
- Navigable (blue)
- Reachable (orange)
- Bot position (red)

## 🧼 Cleanup Recommendations

You may safely archive or remove:
- `BotAdaptiveTargetSelector`, `BotEvenlyDistributedTargetSelector` → old/ folder
- `nav_report.html` → auto-generated
- Older scan data files → keep 1-2 for test runs

---

## 🧪 Quick Start

```bash
# Load config
data.file=scan_data-9.json

# Launch from terminal or IDE
java -jar navcalc.jar
```
